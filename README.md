In this repository is presented a code to compute the transfer entropy, from time series (it was mainly used for binary time series).

sourceCl.jl, contains functions to simulate two time series that interact according to arbitrary functiions, and the code to calculate the transfer entropy value.

sourceQt.jl, contains the code that defines some usefull quantum mechanical qoperators, as well as functions to simulate measurements on two qubits circuits.

trees.jl, function that work on trees, mainly binary trees, and that can create a tree given a desired quantum circuit.

structs.jl, all the structs used.
